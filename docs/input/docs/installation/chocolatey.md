# Via Chocolatey

It is possible to install the portable version of GitReleaseManager using Chocolatey.  Simply execute the following installation command:

```choco install gitreleasemanager.portable```

:::{.alert .alert-info}
Depending on which version of Chocolatey you are using, you may be required to confirm the installation of the application.  You can avoid this prompt using the following command:

```choco install gitreleasemanager.portable -y```
:::

Once installed, GitReleaseManager should be immediately available on the command line.  You can either use:

```
gitreleasemanager
```

or:

```
grm
```

Which should then output something similar to the following:
