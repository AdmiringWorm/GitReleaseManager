# Via Chocolatey

It is possible to install the portable version of GitReleaseManager using Chocolatey.  Simply execute the following installation command:

```choco install gitreleasemanager.portable```

<div class="admonition error">
    <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
    <p class="last">
        Depending on which version of Chocolatey you are using, you may be required to confirm the installation of the application.  You can avoid this prompt using the following command:

```choco install gitreleasemanager.portable -y```
    </p>
</div>

Once installed, GitReleaseManager should be immediately available on the command line.  You can either use:

```
gitreleasemanager
```

or:

```
grm
```

Which should then output something similar to the following:
